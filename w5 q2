Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add
some more amount to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named
'amount' with an initial value of $50. Now make two constructors of this class as
follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Piggie Bank
Create an object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in the Piggie
Bank.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class AddAmount{
    int amount;
    public:
    AddAmount(){
        amount=50;
    }
    AddAmount(int a){
        amount=50;
        amount += a;
    }
    void displayamount(){
        cout<<amount<<endl;
    }
};
int main(){
    AddAmount a1;
    AddAmount a2(15);
    a1.displayamount();
    a2.displayamount();
    
    return 0;
}
